Project Title (Game name): Doomers 
 
1. Game description (detailed): 
Doomers is a fast-paced sci-fi shooter that combines first-person and third-person 
perspectives in the same game. The player is an elite soldier trapped in a demon-
infested research facility and must escape by fighting enemies, solving simple maze-like 
paths, and performing parkour jumps across platforms and hazards. 
The core gameplay is as follows: the player sprints through corridors, shoots 
demons and zombie enemies, and collects ammo, health packs, and keycards to 
unlock new areas. Parkour elements (running, jumping between platforms, 
climbing short ledges) are required to navigate the environment and to reach 
collectibles. 
The game has two main levels (environments). In the first one, the player moves 
inside an indoor lab / bunker with narrow corridors and security doors. In the 
second one, the player goes to an outdoor hell-like arena with wider spaces and 
open air environment. 
A flashlight is attached to the player’s weapon and follows the camera direction, 
providing a moving light source in dark areas. The final score is based on: 
number of enemies killed, collectibles obtained, and time taken to finish both 
levels. The player can switch at any time between a first-person view (camera as 
the eyes) and a third-person view (camera behind and above the character) to 
experience both FPS and 3rd-person shooter styles in one game.

2. First environment models (obstacles, collectibles, target): All models are textured. 
Specify what models to be used (human, car, tank, coins, ... etc) 
Environment 1: “Abandoned Research Facility”  
1. Player character is an armed soldier with a gun  
2. Basic enemy demon / zombie model. 
3. Metal crates and sci-fi boxes (obstacles, used for cover and parkour). 
4. Sliding security doors and gate frames (blocking paths, visual obstacles). 
5. Collectibles to affect the health (health pack) 
6. Ammo boxes (magazines). 
7. Main “lab core” / reactor or portal device as the target model for level 1 
(reach and activate it to finish the level). 
3. Second environment models (obstacles, collectibles, target): All models are textured. 
Specify what models to be used (human, car, tank, coins, ... etc) 
Environment 2: “Rooftop / Hell Arena” (outdoor) 
1. Player character (same soldier model reused). 
2. Advanced demon / boss enemy model (larger enemy). 
3. Rooftop structures: air-conditioning units, pipes, chimneys, antennas 
(obstacles and cover). 
4. Floating or suspended platforms for parkour (metal slabs, broken bridge 
pieces). 
5. Ammo boxes and health packs again as collectibles in harder-to-reach 
places. 
6. Final objective: large glowing obelisk / portal / beacon model that the 
player must reach and activate to win the game.

A first person point of view will be implemented. The camera is the player’s eye. 
4. A third person point of view will be implemented. The camera is behind and slightly 
above the player (the upper part of the player is visible to the camera). 
 
5. Navigation through the game is done using the keyboard and the mouse: 
The keyboard keys are used to move the player 
• W, A, S, D: move forward, left, backward, right. 
• Space: jump  
• Shift: sprint  
The mouse buttons will make the shoot and alternate between camera views. 
• Mouse movement: aim / rotate the camera. 
• Left mouse button: shoot (fire weapon). 
• Right mouse button: toggle between first person and third person camera 
views. 
The score is displayed on the screen. 
6. Generation of animations with every user interaction will be implemented: 
 Shooting an enemy: 
• Gun recoil animation (small rotation + translation of the weapon). 
• Enemy “hit reaction” animation (enemy steps back or slightly falls). 
• Short muzzle-flash light animation (brief strong light at the gun barrel). 
• Gunshot sound effect. 
 Collecting a pickup (ammo, health): 
• Collectible model rotates and scales up slightly, then disappears. 
• A “pickup” sound is played. 
• Score immediately increases.

Jumping / parkour: 
• Player model plays a jump animation (legs bending before jump, landing 
crouch). 
Being hit by an enemy: 
• Short red screen flash or slight camera shake. 
• Hurt sound effect. 
• Player is moved slightly backwards (small translation). 
 
7. There is a light source that changes its color intensity and animates: 
1.  Flashlight attached to the gun (spot light): 
• Follows the camera direction in both first- and third-person modes. 
• Light intensity can slightly flicker in darker areas to give a horror vibe. 
2.  Emergency lights in the lab (level 1): 
• Rotating red siren lights in corridors (point or spot lights). 
• These lights rotate around their vertical axis (rotation transformation) and 
periodically change intensity from dim red to bright red. 
3.  Outdoor / arena main light (level 2): 
• A directional light representing the sky. 
• Its color/intensity gradually changes from orange to dark blue during the 
level, simulating a transition from sunset to night.
